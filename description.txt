Necromancy adds a new weapon class to the game!
Instead of harnessing the power of mana, Necromancers utilize the energy of life force.
A Necromancer can act as a tank, a damage-dealer, or a support, depending on your equipment.
New weapons deal necrotic damage, and they are split up into several types, based on the original 5 classes:

Necrotic melee weapons have much a more limited range than your average melee weapons that shoot projectiles everywhere, but steal life from hit enemies.
Necrotic ranged weapons require no ammo and instead cost life to use, but will give the life back exactly if you hit your targets.
Necrotic magic weapons cost life with no way of getting it back directly, but are also very powerful and can deal massive damage.
Necrotic summon weapons cost a portion of your max life for each summon, but otherwise have no limit to the number of minions you have.
Necrotic throwing weapons cost no life to shoot, but you can spend life to "reload" by right clicking.

This mod also features integration with Thorium, including extra equipment from strange plating, the Lich, and the Ragnarök, as well as necrotic radiant and symphonic weapons!
Necrotic radiant weapons cost a portion of your max life for each summon, but otherwise have no limit to the number of minions you have.
Necrotic summon weapons cost a portion of your max life for each summon, but otherwise have no limit to the number of minions you have.

Because most bonuses to necrotic damage are not specific to a specific type, you can choose whichever weapons you want to use at any time, but there are also some bonuses that allow you to specialize into a subclass.

Every part of this mod is open-source, so if you're making your own mod and are wondering how to go about making a weapon class, or otherwise want to see how something in here is made, feel free to take a look!
You can use tModReader to unpack the .tmod file. Google can help you if you don't know what that means.
