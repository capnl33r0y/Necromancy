Note: this is a very early version of this mod. It is bound to be very unbalanced. You can help me fix it by sharing your thoughts on the discord: http://discord.gg/eBKT8NC
Note: there's going to be a lot of bugs in multiplayer especially. Singleplayer will be more stable and playable, but hopefully I can fix multiplayer bugs eventually too. Report them on the discord when you encounter them.

Necromancy adds a new weapon class to the game!
Instead of harnessing the power of mana, Necromancers utilize the energy of life force.
A Necromancer can act as a tank, a damage-dealer, or a support, depending on your equipment.
New weapons deal necrotic damage, and they come in several types, based on the original 5 classes:

This mod also features integration with Thorium, including extra equipment from strange plating, the Fallen Beholder, the Strider, the Lich, Abyssion, and the Ragnarök, as well as necrotic radiant and symphonic weapons!

Bonuses to necrotic damage are not specific to a subtype, so you can specialize into only this one class while still having a large variety of playstyles.

Some more specific information on this mod is on the Github wiki: https://github.com/sleurk/Necromancy/wiki

Every part of this mod is open-source, so if you're making your own mod and are wondering how to go about making a weapon class, or otherwise want to see how something in here is made, feel free to take a look!

Alternatively, you can use tModReader to unpack the .tmod file. Google can help you if you don't know what that means.

(Something something imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. These are cool things that I like. If there's legal issues or something I can remove/rework them into something different)
